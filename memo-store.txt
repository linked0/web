# how to set calldata with temporary storage

# today's plan
- lecture : dao, call attack
- code: callattack, dao


# tomorrow's plan: Wendesday
- code: flashloan, frontrunning, gas-manipulation

# call attack: 빨
- 1. Factory(Ownable/Initializable) - Minimal proxy(eip1167) - Admin Proxy(eip1967) / Beacon Proxy - Implementation(ReentrancyGuard) - Beacon
  -- Potential Solution: OZ "Address" library
    -- isContract, sendValue, functionCall, functionCallWithValue, functionStaticCall, functionDelegateCall etc
    -- 자동적으로 revert 함.
  -- uint256[50] private __gap; (OpenZepperlin privides)
- 3. DiamondProxy(delegate call) but erc6900(call) due to proxy data security issue
- 2. key cautions: Ensure the storage layout of the new implementation matches the layout of the original.
- Account existence must be checked prior to calling if needed.
- delegatecall: target contract에서 msg.sender와 msg.value는 바뀌지 않음.
  -- proxy contract에서 사용됨.
  -- MultiSig Wallet, Smart Wallet, Account Abstraction
  -- Bridges & Cross-Chain Messaging
- prxoy: gas saving, upgradability
- Relations among Minimal Clones and other proxies.
- Factory deploy other contracts
- create2 is very inefficient
  -- EIP 1167 is a standard for deploying minimal proxy contracts, also known as "clones".
- Proxy issues
  -- Storage Collisions
  -- Initialization issues: 
  -- Frontrunning issues: intialize function
  -- Key Leakage & Centralization issue
