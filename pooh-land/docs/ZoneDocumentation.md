# Zone Documentation

The `zone` of the order is an optional secondary account attached to the order with two additional privileges:

1. The zone may cancel orders where it is named as the zone by calling `cancel`. (Note that offerers can also cancel their own orders, either individually or for all orders signed with their current counter at once by calling `incrementCounter`).
2. "Restricted" orders (as specified by the order type) must either be executed by the zone or the offerer, or must be approved as indicated by a call to an `isValidOrder` or `isValidOrderIncludingExtraData` view function on the zone.

An example zone contract implementation can be found at `/contracts/zones/PausableZone.sol`.

The `PausableZone` contract can be used by its controller to cancel orders, execute fulfillment on restricted order, and pause all orders which use it as a zone.

## Ideas

Zones are a powerful addition to the idea of simple marketplaces. By adding additional logic to approve / reject Seaport orders, many new applications are possible. Zones could potentially be used by new marketplaces built on top of Seaport to:

- Stop sales of stolen assets
- Pause orders in case of emergency without invalidating users' approvals
- Limit the number of NFTs from a particular collection that can be sold in a given amount of time
- Enforce a particular floor or ceiling price for certain assets
- Make other arbitrary calls to outside price oracles
- Track extra incentives for users completing valid orders
- And more.

Anyone in the world can build and deploy their own unique zones and help decentralize Seaport as a protocol.
