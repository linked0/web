# DAO Attack 2

## Intro
"The Grid" is a DAO created to provide a decentralized and sustainable energy infrastructure for communities worldwide. 

The Grid was made up of a diverse group of individuals from all over the world, including engineers, environmentalists, and community leaders.

Grid DAO purchases and installs renewable energy systems in underprivileged communities, such as solar panels and wind turbines. The energy generated by these systems was then sold back to the grid, with the profits used to fund the installation of even more renewable energy systems.

All profits flow to "The Grid" Treasury!

In the case of a new investment opportunity, the DAO votes on a proposal.
In case of a majority, the proposal passes and the ETH is withdrawn from the treasury.

Currently, there is 1000 ETH in the Treasury.

### DAO Token Holders:

* Deployer - 1500 Tokens
* Member 1 - 1000 Tokens
* Member 2 - 1000 Tokens
* You - 10 Tokens

Given that you only own 10 DAO tokens, and assuming any "malicious" proposal you create will be voted down by other DAO members, can you steal all the ETH?

## Accounts
* 0 - Deployer
* 1 - DAO Member 1
* 2 - DAO Member 2
* 3 - Attacker (You)
* 4 - Random User

## Tasks

### Task 1
Steal all the ETH in the Treasury.

**Important: assume that every proposal you suggest will be voted "no" by other DAO members.**
