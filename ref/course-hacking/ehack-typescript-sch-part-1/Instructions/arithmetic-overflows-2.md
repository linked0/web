# Arithmetic Over/Underflow Exercise 2

## Intro
There is a new token deployed on MAINNET.

The deployer minted 10 tokens for you, and 100k tokens for himself :(

Your goal is to hack the smart contract and get at least 1 million tokens!

## Accounts
* 0 - Deployer & Owner
* 1 - Attacker (You)

## Tasks

### Task 1
Hack the contract so you have 1 million tokens.

TIP: You may create / use other accounts on the evm, as far as it's not the deployer account.

### Task 2
Fix the smart contract so no one is able to attack it the same way you did.
