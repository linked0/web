JohnnyTime's smart contract hacking course part 2 exercises WITH the solutions.

# Smart Contract Hacking Exercises Guidelines

## Structure
* The following repository is a hardhat project
* There are 3 main folders:
  * `./instructions` - All the instructions for the exercises
  * `./contracts` - The smart contracts of the exercises
  * `./test` - The test files to execute the exercises and complete them

## Setup & Exercise Execution

### Dependencies
* From the root folder run: `npm i`

### RPC NODE - For Mainnet and Goerli Forks
* Sign up to [Infura](https://infura.io/dashboard) and get an Ethereum Mainnet URL for free.
* Copy the `.env-example` file and call it `.env` then set there your Infura URL for:
  * `MAINNET` - Ethereum Mainnet
  * `GOERLI` - Goerli Testnet

### Exercise Execution
* To execute and test an exercise, run the command `npm run [exercise-name]` from the root folder
* You can always check all the exercise names in the `./package.json` file

### Exercise Execution Example
In case you are working on the exercise "oracle-manipulation-2":
* Feel free to create contracts under `./contracts/oracle-manipulation-2/`
* Feel free to change `./tests/oracle-manipulation-2/tests.js` file

Execute from the root folder: `npm run oracle-manipulation-2` to check if you completed the exercise successfully.

## Guidelines
Unless you've been told otherwise in a specific exercise, you may not change the EVM state with special hardhat functionalities (balances, block time, etc...), and you may not change the `before` and `after` sections in the test files.
