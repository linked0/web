# Call Attacks Exercise 2

## Intro
SecureStore Inc. provides physical storage solutions for a wide range of clients. The warehouse at SecureStore offers flexible rental terms and easy access.

In order to ensure greater transparency and accountability for their clients, SecureStore decided to move their warehouse access management system to a blockchain-based solution.

Renters can rent a warehouse for as long as they need, and they may also cancel the rental and receive a refund for the remaining time.

SecureStore has received countless USDC payments as a result of this innovative approach.

Can you find a vulnerability in the SecureStore contracts that would allow you to steal all their funds?
