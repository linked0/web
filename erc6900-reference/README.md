# ERC-6900 Reference Implementation

Reference implementation for [ERC-6900](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6900).

The implementation includes an upgradable modular account with 5 modules (`SingleSignerValidationModule`, `TokenReceiverModule`, `AllowlistModule`, `ERC20TokenLimitModule`, and `NativeTokenLimitModule`). It is compliant with the latest version of ERC-6900.

## Important callouts

- **Not audited and SHOULD NOT be used in production**.
- Not optimized in both deployments and execution. Weâ€™ve explicitly removed some optimizations in favor of clarity.

## Development

Anyone is welcome to submit feedback and/or PRs to improve code.

### Installing dependencies
```
forge install
```

### Testing

The default Foundry profile can be used to compile (without IR) and test the entire project. The default profile should be used when generating coverage and debugging.

```bash
forge build
forge test -vvv
```

Since IR compilation generates different bytecode, it's useful to test against the contracts compiled via IR. Since compiling the entire project (including the test suite) takes a long time, special profiles can be used to precompile just the source contracts, and have the tests deploy the relevant contracts using those artifacts.

```bash
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=optimized-build forge build
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=optimized-test forge test -vvv
```

    Test one file
```
forge test --match-path test/account/UpgradeableModularAccount.t.sol
```

Test one function
```
forge test -vvvv --match-test test_jay_basicUserOp

forge test -vvvv --match-path test/account/UpgradeableModularAccount.t.sol --match-test test_jay_basicUserOp
```

## Integration testing

The reference implementation provides a sample factory and deploy script for the factory, account implementation, and the demo validation module `SingleSignerValidationModule`. This is not audited nor intended for production use. Limitations set by the GPLv3 license apply.

To run this script, provide appropriate values in a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` template, then run:

```bash
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol <wallet options> -r <rpc_url> --broadcast
```

Where `<wallet_options>` specifies a way to sign the deployment transaction (see [here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-script#wallet-options---raw)) and `<rpc_url>` specifies an RPC for the network you are deploying on.
