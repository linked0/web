# ReEntrancy Exercise 2

## Intro
There is a new NFT project with a lot of hype around it. It's called SuperDuperApes!

Only 50 unique Apes will be minted to the loyal community members of the Apes community.

1 Ape mint per wallet.

There is a smart contract `ApesAirdrop.sol` that allows you to mint ONLY 1 NFT, your goal is to hack the smart contract and mint for yourself all the 50 NFT and become Super Duper Rich Ape.
