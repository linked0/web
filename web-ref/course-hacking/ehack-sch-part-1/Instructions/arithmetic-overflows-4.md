# Arithmetic Over/Underflow Exercise 4

## Intro
A new token has been deployed!

The deployer minted for himself 1 million tokens and you have nothing :(

Can you hack the smart contract and create tokens for yourself out of air?

## Accounts
* 0 - Deployer & Owner
* 1 - Attacker (You)

## Tasks

### Task 1
Find a way to exploit the smart contract so you will have more tokens than the initial supply (1 Million).

### Task 2
Create a secured version of the contract so you won't be able to exploit it.
